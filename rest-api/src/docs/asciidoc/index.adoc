This document describes the API of Nobt.io. There are 3 requests that can be made at the moment:

* Create a new nobt
* Add an expense to a given nobt
* Retrieve the nobt

== Domain glossary

The most important domain terms are:

include::domain-glossary.adoc[]

== Create a new nobt

To create a new nobt, issue an http request like this:

include::{snippets}/create-nobt/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/create-nobt/request-fields.adoc[]

The response looks like this:

include::{snippets}/create-nobt/http-response.adoc[]

In addition to the information that was sent to the API, two arrays are returned. `expenses` and `transaction`. We will look into those further after we have added an expense to this nobt and retrieved it again.

== Add an expense to a nobt

Given the url in the `Location` header that was returned in the previous response, we can add an expense to this nobt if we post an expense to the `/expenses` sub-resource.

include::{snippets}/create-expense/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/create-expense/request-fields.adoc[]

The request was successful if the server returns a statuscode of 201. For convenience, the response includes the sent data.

include::{snippets}/create-expense/http-response.adoc[]

== Retrieve the nobt

Once we add at least one expense, it makes sense to re-retrieve the nobt we created before.

include::{snippets}/get-nobt/http-request.adoc[]

This time, the response is way more interesting, as it includes transactions.
