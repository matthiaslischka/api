This document describes the API of Nobt.io. There are 5 requests that can be made at the moment:

* Create a new nobt
* Add an expense to a given nobt
* Add a payment to a given nobt
* Retrieve the nobt
* Delete an expense

== Domain glossary

The most important domain terms are:

include::domain-glossary.adoc[]

== Create a new nobt

To create a new nobt, issue an http request like this:

include::{snippets}/create-nobt/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/create-nobt/request-fields.adoc[]

The response looks like this:

include::{snippets}/create-nobt/http-response.adoc[]

In addition to the information that was sent to the API, three arrays are returned. `expenses`, `payments` and `debts`. We will look into those further after we have added an expense to this nobt and retrieved it again.

== Add an expense to a nobt

=== Shares

Creating an expense requires some client logic as the API only accepts `shares` of an expense.
The client must split the overall amount of the expense in shares consisting of the name of the debtor and the associated amount.
The sum of all amounts of all shares forms the overall amount of the expense.

This design allows the client to present the user with several possibilities to split his expense. For example:

- Split by percentage
- Split evenly among debtors
- Split by weighted shares
- Custom value per debtor

The client may store an identifier in the `splitStrategy` field for each expense that identifies the way the shares have been calculated.

=== Currencies

An expense may have been made in a different currency than the one specified when the nobt was created. E.g. the currency of the nobt may be `EUR`, but the expense that should be added to the nobt was made in `USD`.
The request below shows the `conversionInformation` object which may define the currency of this expense and the conversion rate.
The `conversionInformation` object is optional. If omitted, it defaults to the currency defined in the nobt with a conversion rate of `1`.

Given the url in the `Location` header that was returned in the previous response, we can add an expense to this nobt if we post an expense to the `/expenses` sub-resource.

include::{snippets}/create-expense/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/create-expense/request-fields.adoc[]

The request was successful if the server returns a status-code of 201.

include::{snippets}/create-expense/http-response.adoc[]

Sending a faulty request results in a status-code of 400. In the case of creating an expense for a nobt, this occurs if the same debtor (identified by the name), occurs twice in the list of shares for an expense.

An example for such a faulty request would be:

include::{snippets}/duplicate-debtor/http-request.adoc[]

The response in the case of an validation failure is:

include::{snippets}/duplicate-debtor/http-response.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/duplicate-debtor/response-fields.adoc[]

== Add a payment

After an expense was added to the Nobt the current debts are included in the response of the nobt. See the output below.

In order to settle one of these debts, payments can be added. A payment is a flow of money from one person to another that can contain a description. Payments may also be made in other currencies. For more information on currency conversion, see the section Currencies above.

The following example request shows, how to add a payment.

include::{snippets}/add-payment/http-request.adoc[]

Equivalently to expenses, a `201 CREATED` is returned.

include::{snippets}/add-payment/http-response.adoc[]

== Retrieve the nobt

Once we add at least one expense, it makes sense to re-retrieve the nobt we created before.

include::{snippets}/get-nobt/http-request.adoc[]

This time, the response is way more interesting, as it includes debts. Note that we also already added payment, which is immediately reflected in the resulting debts.

include::{snippets}/get-nobt/http-response.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/get-nobt/response-fields.adoc[]

== Delete an expense

Expenses can be deleted from the nobt in order to exclude it from the debt calculation. However, expenses are not actually deleted from the database but rather only marked as deleted.

If an expense can be deleted, it has a link attached with a link relation `delete`. Sending an `HTTP` `DELETE` request to this link marks an expense as deleted. This operation cannot be undone.
