## Version 0.0.3:

This version drops the support for profiles and instead introduces specific environment variables for configuration. 
This allows for a more fine-grained configuration of the API.

For backwards-compatiblity reasons, a shell and a bash-script are located under the `bin/` folder that configure the application in the same way the `STANDALONE` profile did before.

## Version 0.0.2:

The main change in this version is the introduction of `shares` per expense that allows the client to split an expense into arbitrary parts. Previously an expense was always evenly split among all participants. Due to this change, two endpoints required breaking changes.

### Breaking changes

- `POST /nobts/{id}/expenses`
    - `amount` field removed.
    - `debtors` field removed.
    - `splitStrategy` field added.
    - `shares` field added.
    - A check has been added that rejects requests with non-unique names inside the `shares` field.
    
- `GET /nobts/{id}`  
    - `expenses` field semantics changed. (All changes above apply to each element of the expenses array.)
